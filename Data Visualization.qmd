```{r}
streaming <- read_csv("data/data_streaming/all_streaming.csv")
streaming
```

\

Lets check the columns

```{r}
names(streaming)
```

Count the number of movies and by channel streaming

```{r}
streaming |>
  select(channel_streaming, title) |>
  group_by(channel_streaming) |>
  summarise(title_count = n()) |>
  arrange(desc(title_count))
  

```

Get rid of the full name of the channel and only the platform

```{r}
names(streaming)
streaming <- streaming |>
  mutate(platform = word(channel_streaming, 1, sep = "-")) |>
  select(-channel_streaming)

relocate(streaming,platform)

```

What are our plans now? To see which platform has the more "classical/old" movies

```{r}
only_movies <- streaming |>
  filter(movie_or_serie == "Movie") |>
  select(-movie_or_serie)

only_movies
```

We have movies from 1927 till 2019 a classical movie is until 1969, after that is considered a contemporary film

```{r}
only_movies |>
  group_by(release_year) |>
  summarise(title = n()) |>
  arrange(desc(title))
  
classification <- only_movies |>
  mutate(classical = case_when(
  release_year <=1969 ~ 'classical',
  release_year >=1970 ~ 'contemporary'))
  
```

We check how many classical movies each platform has

```{r}
classification$platform <- factor(classification$platform)
levels(classification$platform)
```

```{r}
classification |>
  ggplot(aes(x=fct_infreq(platform), fill=classical)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge")+
  geom_text(stat='count', aes(label=after_stat(count))) +
  labs(x="Platform", y="Number of movies", fill='Category', title='Movies by platform', subtitle = "A movie before 1969 is considered classical")
```
